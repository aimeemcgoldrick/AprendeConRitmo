# AprendeConRitmo
This is a personal project.
The project is being completed using Java Processing.
The aim of the project is to create a user interactive site. This site will prompt the user to select their current mood and, based on this mood the user will be given a choice of Spanish songs which fit their mood. The user will then choose a song. The song will play and the user will be given linguistic information about the song to facilitate learning the Spanish language with colloquial expressions and relatable content.
